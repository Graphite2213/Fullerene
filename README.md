# Fullerene
Fullerene is a toy OS i am making in my spare time.
I have no intention of making it "good" or "usable"
because it's just a fun project to work on.

If you for for whatever reason want to use it you
can by:

- Cloning the source code
- Running the docker container
- Running `make build-x86_64`
- Using QEMU's `qemu-system-x86_64` command on the
`kernel.iso` file
